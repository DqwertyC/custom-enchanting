# datapacks
A collection of my Minecraft datapacks.
Each folder is it's own separate pack and can be placed in the "datapacks" folder of your world save.

**custom_enchanting** 
This datapack provides a method to create custom enchantments. Throw an XP Bottle at an enchantment table, and it should activate. Place materials around the sides of the table and the item to enchant on top, then throw another XP Bottle at it.  

**arcane_eye**
This datapack adds a bow enchantment that lets the player's camera follow their arrows

**blazes_touch**
This datapack adds a tool enchantment that autosmelts ores

**enders_reach** 
This datapack adds a chestplate enchantment that allows the wearer to place blocks in midair

**rabbit_leap**
This datapack adds a leggings enchantment that allows the wearer to jump higher by crouching for a bit before jumping

**shulker_shot**
This datapack adds a bow enchantment that causes arrows to move in a straight line after being fired

**tp_trident** 
Uses the custom_enchanting and uuid_utils datapacks above to create a trident that teleports the player to itself when it hits the ground or an entity. It costs 1 elytra, 2 ender pearls, and 1 Feather Falling IV book to enchant.

**uuid_utils**
This datapack stores UUIDs as scores to allow easy selection and assignment of entity owners
